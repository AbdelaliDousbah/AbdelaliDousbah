I’m a **Linux System Engineer** with a deep love for everything open-source, automation, and keeping systems running like a well-oiled machine. If there's one thing I've learned, it's that "Everything is a file"—and I make sure that file is in the right place at the right time! 😄

## What I Do

I'm the kind of person who:
- Finds elegance in shell scripts 🖥️
- Loves debugging obscure issues (seriously, where did that segfault come from?!) 🔍
- Believes no system is too complex to optimize 🚀
- And always looks for ways to **automate all the things**! 🤖

Here's what I bring to the table:

### 💻 Operating Systems:
- **Linux Distributions:** RedHat, Debian, Ubuntu, OpenBSD
- **Kernel Tuning:** Optimizing system performance with sysctl and kernel modules.
- **Package Management:** YUM, APT, Snap, dpkg.

### ☁️ Cloud and Virtualization:
- **Cloud Platforms:** AWS, Azure, GCP, OpenStack
- **Containers:** Docker, LXC, Kubernetes, Helm Charts
- **Virtualization:** KVM, Proxmox, VMware ESXi, Vagrant
- **Infrastructure Automation:** Ansible, Terraform, Packer
- **Auto Scaling:** Configuring and managing Auto Scaling Groups in AWS.
- **Hybrid Cloud:** Designing and deploying hybrid cloud environments.

### 🌐 Web and Proxy Servers:
- **Web Servers:** Apache, Nginx, Lighttpd
- **Load Balancing:** HAProxy, Nginx reverse proxy, AWS ALB.
- **SSL/TLS Configuration:** Let's Encrypt, Certbot, managing certificates and security hardening.

### 🛠️ Infrastructure as Code (IaC):
- **Ansible Playbooks:** Automating infrastructure tasks from provisioning to patching.
- **Terraform:** Building and managing infrastructure in the cloud.
- **GitOps:** Applying continuous deployment strategies using GitLab CI and GitHub Actions.

### ⚙️ DevOps & Automation:
- **CI/CD:** Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD, CircleCI, Travis CI
- **Monitoring:** Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack, Zabbix
- **Backup and Recovery:** Setting up automated backup systems, disaster recovery plans with Bacula, Restic, and Snapshots (LVM, ZFS).

### 📡 Networking:
- **Protocols:** TCP/IP, HTTP, DNS, DHCP, SNMP, LDAP, OpenVPN.
- **Firewalls & Security:** Iptables, UFW, Fail2ban, WireGuard VPN.
- **Network Troubleshooting:** Wireshark, tcpdump, netstat, iproute2.

### 🛡️ Security:
- **Hardening:** Securing Linux systems using SELinux, AppArmor, auditing logs with auditd.
- **Identity and Access Management:** OpenLDAP, FreeIPA, PAM, managing SSH keys and access control.
- **Compliance:** Implementing CIS benchmarks, automating security audits with OpenSCAP, and ensuring systems meet compliance standards.

### 💡 Scripting & Automation:
- **Scripting Languages:** Bash, Python, Perl
- **Task Automation:** Automating mundane tasks with cron jobs and systemd timers.
- **Regular Expressions:** Mastering the art of `sed`, `awk`, and `grep` for log parsing and data manipulation.

### 📧 Mail Servers:
- **SMTP/IMAP:** Postfix, Dovecot, Exim
- **Spam Filtering:** SpamAssassin, Amavis

- **DKIM & SPF:** Configuring and maintaining email deliverability with domain keys and sender policies.

### 📊 Databases:
- **Relational Databases:** MySQL, PostgreSQL
- **NoSQL:** Redis, MongoDB
- **Database Optimization:** Query tuning, replication, and backup strategies.

### 🚀 Miscellaneous:
- **Git & Version Control:** GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket—because who doesn't love a good pull request? 😎
- **File Systems:** Ext4, Btrfs, OpenZFS, XFS—especially love tuning ZFS for optimal performance.
- **Quotas & Permissions:** Fine-tuning disk usage and permissions for multi-user environments.

## Why Linux?

Because Linux is freedom! 🐧 The flexibility, stability, and power it offers make it a perfect playground for engineers like me who love to tinker, automate, and keep systems secure. Whether I'm setting up servers, monitoring system health, or writing automation scripts, every day is an adventure in the world of Linux.

## Fun Fact:

I can write Bash scripts in my sleep! (Okay, maybe not *literally* in my sleep, but it sure feels like it sometimes). 😅
